$ yarn add quorum-sdk-electron-main
```

## Setup

In Electron main.js

```js
const { app } = require('electron');
const Quorum = require('quorum-sdk-electron-main');

Quorum.init({
	quorumBinPath: app.isPackaged
    ? `${process.resourcesPath}/quorum-bin` : `${app.getAppPath()}/node_modules/quorum-bin`,
});
```

## Setup for Electron building

In package.json, add `extraResources` config for adding quorum binary to electron app when packaging:

```json
{
  ...
  "build": {
    ...
    "mac": {
      ...
      "extraResources": [
        {
          "from": "node_modules/quorum-bin/quorum_darwin",
          "to": "quorum-bin/quorum_darwin"
        }
      ]
    },
    "win": {
      ...
      "extraResources": [
        {
          "from": "node_modules/quorum-bin/quorum_win.exe",
          "to": "quorum-bin/quorum_win.exe"
        }
